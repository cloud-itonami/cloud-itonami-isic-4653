;; The ag-machinery-trading domain checks (credit-clearance, contract-
;; on-file, emissions-certification, ROPS-certification, sanctions-
;; screening) are direct entity booleans in the governor, NOT pure
;; registry range functions -- so this registry has NO range-check
;; suite to test (unlike the crude-extraction sibling's reservoir/
;; annular/water-cut/H2S functions). Only record construction is here.
